/*
Do you remember the contact list you created while doing the task from the previous Lab? 
You have to admit that at first glance it looked quite strange. We had to use nine variables
to store information about just three users. What's worse, adding each new user would
require the creation of three more variables. This is neither convenient nor practical.
Fortunately, since then we have learned something about arrays and objects, which will
allow us to save our list in a slightly more convenient way. Using the same data as in
the previous Lab, create the contact list as an array, each element of which will be 
an object describing a single user. So we should get a three-element array, and each 
object placed in it will contain three pieces of information (name, phone, and email).

At the end of the list declared in this way, add a new contact using the appropriate array method.
The new contact is: Maisie Haley / 0913 531 3030 / risus.Quisque@urna.ca.

Display the first and last contact, again in the format: name / phone / email.
Use the length property of the array to determine the index of the last element. 
Remember that the array elements are indexed starting at 0.
